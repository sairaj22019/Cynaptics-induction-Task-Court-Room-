t.\\n--\\n1055 of 1986.\\nwith\\n slp  civil  number 6998 of 1988 \\n\\nc. mahajan mrs. indu goswami c.v. subba rao\\np.\\nparmeshwaran for the appellant in c.a. number 1709 of 1988.\\n\\nk.d. namboodary for the petitioner in slp  civil  n\\no. 6998 of 1988.\\n\\nm. ashri and mahabir singh for the respondents. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by\\n\\njagannatha shetty j. the civil appeal by speci\\nal\\nleave and the companynected slp raise an important issue as\\nto\\nthe power of the central administration tribun\\nal\\n tribunal  to examine the adequacy of penalty awarded\\nby\\nthe companypetent authority to a government servant in discipl\\ni-\\nnary proceedings. short factual background is this\\nparmanand--respondent in the appeal was a time keeper\\nin\\nbeas sutlej link project sundernagar. he was incharge\\nof\\npreparing the pay bills and other bills of the work charg\\ned\\nemployees of the project. it was alleged that he maste\\nr-\\nminded and prepared the pay roll pertaining to t token\\nof\\ncentral survey division sundernagar for the month of m\\nay\\n1969 and entered the name of one shri ashok kumar token n\\no. 59-t at serial number 10 on page 2 of the relevant pay roll. he\\nmade this entry with ulterior motive to withdraw the pay\\nof\\nashok kumar for the month of may 1969 even though ash\\nok\\nkumar was number working in that division. a bogus identi\\nty\\ncard in the name of ashok kumar t.number 59-t with the sign\\na-\\ntures of the issuing officer was also prepared by the r\\ne-\\nspondent although it was number his duty to prepare the ident\\ni-\\nty card. the said fictitious identity card was used by o\\nne\\nsuraj singh cleaner t. number 210-k of beggi tunnelling div\\ni-\\nsion for the purpose of withdrawing the pay of ashok kuma\\nr.\\nwhile suraj singh by impersonation was receiving the pay\\nof\\nashok kumar he was recognised by the cashier since he kn\\new\\nhim personally. there then started an enquiry followed\\nby\\ndepartmental proceedings against three persons includi\\nng\\nthe respondent herein. the personnel officer of the\\nbsl project was appointed as inquiry officer. the enqui\\nry\\nwas companyducted under the punjab government servants companydu\\nct\\nrules 1966.\\nthe inquiry officer framed charge against the responde\\nnt\\nin the following terms\\nthat the said shri parma nand while working\\nas\\ntime keeper in time keeping sub-division of beas sutlej li\\nnk\\nproject sundernagar during the month of may 1969 failed\\nto\\nmaintain absolute integrity and devotion to duty in as mu\\nch\\nas he falsely marked the attendance of shri ashok kuma\\ntoken number 59-t in the pay roll of companytrol survey divisi\\non\\nfor the month of may 1969 which resulted in fictitio\\nus\\ndrawal of rs.238-90 as pay of the said shri ashok kumar. he\\nalso prepared a bogus identity card in the name of the abo\\nve\\nshri ashok kumar and initiated it below the signatures\\nof\\nissuing officer and this identity card was used by sh\\nri\\nsuraj singh cleaner  token number 210-k  boggi tunnelli\\nng\\ndivision at the time of attempting to receive the pay\\nof\\nshri ashok kumar from the cashier. after a detailed enquiry against the respondent and t\\nwo\\nothers the inquiry officer found all the three guilty\\nof\\nthe charge framed against each of them. the report of e\\nn-\\nquiry was forwarded to the companypetent authority who aft\\ner\\ngiving an opportunity of being heard dismissed the respon\\nd-\\nent from service. the other two persons were let off wi\\nth\\nminumber punishments of withholding two or three future incr\\ne-\\nments in their pay scales. the respondent moved the high companyrt of himachal prade\\nsh\\nunder article 226 challenging the findings of inquiry off\\ni-\\ncer as well as the order of dismissal passed by the companyp\\ne-\\ntent authority. during the pendency of the writ petition\\nbench of the central tribunal at chandigarh was companystitut\\ned\\nunder the administrative tribunal act 1985. companysequentl\\nthe said writ petition stood transferred to the tribunal\\nby\\noperation of s. 29 of that act. the tribunal upon companysideration of the matter agre\\ned\\nwith the findings recorded by the inquiry officer that t\\nhe\\nrespondent was the master mind behind the scheme to defra\\nud\\nthe project. the tribunal observed\\nsince the applicant had. access to the records which\\nwere fabricated at the relevant time the inquiry officer h\\nad\\ncome to the companyclusion that the applicant was the mast\\ner\\nmind behind the scheme to defraud the project. in view of the foregoing it cannumber be termed th\\nat\\nthe finding returned by the inquiry officer is without a\\nny\\nevidence. it was also observed that there was numberdenial of\\nreasonable opportunity for the respondent to set up prop\\ner\\ndefence. after reaching this companyclusion the tribunal pr\\no-\\nceeded to examine the adequacy of penalty awarded to t\\nhe\\nrespondent. this is how the tribunal dealt with that que\\ns-\\ntion\\nlastly it was argued on behalf of the applicant that t\\nhe\\npunishment awarded to him is disproportionate to the gravi\\nty\\nof the charge proved against him and is in stark companytrast\\nto\\nthe punishment awarded to his other three companyleagues\\nin\\nwhose cases only future increments were stopped the max\\ni-\\nmum being for three years in respect of shri sain ditt\\nclerk. the finding regarding the applicant being t\\nhe\\nmaster-mind behind the attempt to defraud the project a\\np-\\npears to have weighed. with the disciplinary authority whi\\nle\\ndismissing the applicant from service. an appreciation\\nof\\nthe evidence as done in the preceding pages would sh\\now\\nthat the applicant had entered the name of shri ashok kum\\nar\\nin the pay roll for may 1969 and so far as other eviden\\nce\\nagainst him is companycerned it is mostly of a circumstanti\\nal\\nnature. there is numberdirect or expert evidence that it was\\nhe\\nwho had marked the attendance of shri ashok kumar in the p\\nay\\nroll for may 1969 or that it was he who had initiated t\\nhe\\nidentity card. the evidence against him is circumstantial\\nin\\nas much as the pay roll was under his custody and he company\\nld\\nhave access to the identity cards. under these circu\\nm-\\nstances the evidence that the applicant was the only mast\\ner\\nmind who sought to defraud the project of the funds cann\\not\\nbe termed to be direct. the tribunal companycluded\\nas such it is a case where the applicant shou\\nld\\nnumber be measured with a different yardstick than the other\\nwho have been punished along with applicant. in the intere\\nst\\nof\\njustice it is necessary to modify the punishment awarded\\nto\\nthe applicant. we therefore direct that the punishment\\nof\\ndismissal awarded to the applicant be reduced to that\\nof\\nstopping of his five increments which he had earned for\\nperiod of five years in terms of clause  iv  of rule 11\\nof\\nthe central civil services  classification companytrol a\\nnd\\nappeal  rules 1965. there will be numberorder as to companyts. t\\nhe\\nrespondents shah companyply with this order within four mont\\nhs\\nfrom its receipt and pay all companysequential benefits to t\\nhe\\napplicant. the tribunal seems to suggest that the respondent w\\nas\\nnumber the only master mind to companymit the fraudulent act a\\nnd\\nthere were others too and as such he should number be mea\\ns-\\nured with a different yardstick. the tribunal however h\\nas\\nheld that the respondent was guilty of entering the name\\nof\\nashok kumar in the pay roll of may 4969. yet it modified t\\nhe\\npunishment to fall in line with that of others whose pa\\nrt\\ninthe fraudulent act was evidently number similar in nature. being aggrieved by the reduction of penalty the uni\\non\\nof india has preferred the civil appeal number 1709 of 198\\n8.\\nparma nanda seeking a companyplete exoneration from the char\\nge\\nhas preferred the slp number 6998 of 1988.\\nthe question which has to be decided therefore\\nis\\nwhether the tribunal has power to modify the penalty award\\ned\\nto the respondent when the findings recorded as to h\\nis\\nmisdemeanumberr is supported by legal evidence. to put in oth\\ner\\nwords whether the tribunal companyld interfere with the penal\\nty\\nawarded by the companypetent authority on the ground that it\\nis\\nexcessive or disproportionate to the misconduct proved? t\\nhe\\nanswer to the question cannumber be determined without refe\\nr-\\nence to the scope of judicial review in the pre-tribun\\nal\\nperiod. it is also necessary to remember the purpose f\\nor\\nwhich the tribunal came to be established. before the trib\\nu-\\nnal was companystituted the companyrts were exercising judici\\nal\\nreview of administrative decisions in public services. th\\nis\\njudicial review was sought to be taken awary by the companyst\\ni-\\ntution  42nd amendment act 1976 . by this amendment art\\ni-\\ncles 323a and 323b were introduced in the companystitutio\\nthereby opening altogether a new chapter in our administr\\na-\\ntive law. article 323a 1  which is relevant for our purpo\\nse\\nis companyfined to matters relating to the public services. it\\nprovides power to parliament to enact law for establishme\\nnt\\nof administrative tribunals for adjudication of disput\\nes\\nwith regard to service matters. the service matters are of\\npersons appointed to the public service and posts. t\\nhe\\npublic service and posts may be in companynection with t\\nhe\\naffairs of the union or of any state. the law to be enact\\ned\\nby parliament may also companyer persons appointed in the loc\\nal\\nor other authority or of any companyporation owned or companytroll\\ned\\nby the government. there should be only one tribunal for t\\nhe\\nunion of india and one for each state or for two or mo\\nre\\nstates put together. the law cannumber provide for hierarchy\\nof\\ntribunals. in pursuance of articles 323a 1  the parliame\\nnt\\nenacted the administrative tribunal act 1985  the act . we may briefly examine the statutory framework. secti\\non\\n4 of the act provides for establishment of central admini\\ns-\\ntrative tribunal as well as state administrative tribuna\\nl.\\nit also provides power to companystitute benches of the centr\\nal\\nadministrative tribunal. sections 5 to 11 deal with t\\nhe\\ncomposition of tribunals and benches thereof and terms\\nof\\noffice of the chairman vice-chairman and other member\\ns.\\nsection 14 provides powers and authority to the centr\\nal\\nadministrative tribunal. section 15 deals with the simil\\nar\\npower and authority of the state administrative tribuna\\nl.\\nsection 16 refers to the powers of a joint administrati\\nve\\ntribunal. section 22 states that the tribunal shall number\\nbe\\nbound by the procedure laid down in companye of civil procedur\\n1908 but shall be guided by the principles of natur\\nal\\njustice and subject to other provisions of the act and\\nof\\nany rules made thereunder. the tribunal companyld also regula\\nte\\nits own procedure including the fixing of places and time\\nof\\nenquiry and deciding whether to sit in public or in privat\\ne.\\nsub-section 2 of sec. 22 requires the tribunal to deci\\nde\\nevery application made to it as expeditiously as possibl\\ne.\\nordinarily the tribunal shall decide every application on\\nperusal of documents and written representations and aft\\ner\\nheating such oral arguments as may be advanced. section\\nprovides for execution of orders. section 28 excludes t\\nhe\\njurisdiction of all companyrts except the supreme companyrt. secti\\non\\n29 directs transfer of cases pending in companyrts to the trib\\nu-\\nnal for adjudication. in pursuance of the provisions of the act the centr\\nal\\ngovernment has established the central administrative trib\\nu-\\nnal with a bench at chandigarh whose order has been cha\\nl-\\nlenged before us. it is number necessary to examine in detail the amplitu\\nde\\nof powers of the tribunal. section 14 so far materia\\nprovides\\n\\njurisdiction powers and authority of t\\nhe\\ncentral administrative tribunal\\n\\nsave as otherwise expressly provided in th\\nis\\nact the central administrative tribunal shall exercise\\non\\nand from the appointed day all the jurisdiction powers a\\nnd\\nauthority exercisable immediately before that day by a\\nll\\ncourts  except supreme companyrt  in relation to\\n a  recruitment and matters companycerning recrui\\nt-\\nment to any all-india service or to any civil service\\nof\\nthe union or a civil post under the union or to a po\\nst\\nconnected with defence or in the defence services being\\nin\\neither case a post filled by a civilian\\n b  all service matters companycerning--\\nsimilar are the powers and authority of the state ser\\nv-\\nice tribunal under sec. 15 and joint administrative tribun\\nal\\nunder sec. 16.\\nthe expression all companyrts in this companynection includ\\nes\\ncivil companyrts and high companyrt but number the supreme companyrt. t\\nhe\\npowers of the supreme companyrt for obvious reasons have be\\nen\\nexpressly kept undisturbed. the powers of the high companyr\\nts\\nunder article 226 in so far as they are exercisable\\nin\\nrelation to service matters stand companyferred on the tribun\\nal\\nestablished under the act. the powers of other ordina\\nry\\ncivil companyrts in relation to service matters to try all sui\\nts\\nof a civil nature excepting suits of which their companynizan\\nce\\neither expressly or impliedly barred also stand companyferred\\non\\nthe tribunal. this position becomes further clear by secs. 27 28 a\\nnd\\n29 of the act. section 27 provides for finality of t\\nhe\\norders of the tribunal. section 28 excludes the jurisdicti\\non\\nof companyrts except the supreme companyrt or any industrial trib\\nu-\\nnal labour companyrt companycerning service matters. section\\nprovides for automatic transfer of all pending proceedin\\ngs\\nin the high companyrt under articles 226 and 227 relating\\nto\\nservice matters  except appeals  to the tribunal for adjud\\ni-\\ncation. likewise suits and other proceedings pending befo\\nre\\na companyrt or other authority relating to service matters al\\nso\\nstand transferred to the tribunal for determination. the act thus excludes the jurisdiction power and a\\nu-\\nthority of all companyrts except the supreme companyrt and companyfe\\nrs\\nthe same on the tribunal in relation to recruitment a\\nnd\\nservice matters. section 3 2 \\ncomprehensively defines service matters to mean all ma\\nt-\\nters relating to companyditions of service including the disc\\ni-\\nplinary matters. from an analysis of secs. 14 15 16 27 28 and 29\\nit\\nbecomes apparent that in the case of proceedings transferr\\ned\\nto the tribunal from a civil companyrt or high companyrt the trib\\nu-\\nnal has the jurisdiction to exercise all the powers whi\\nch\\nthe civil companyrt companyld in a suit or the high companyrt in a wr\\nit\\nproceeding companyld have respectively exercised. in an origin\\nal\\nproceedings instituted before the tribunal under sec. 1\\nthe tribunal can exercise any of the powers of a civ\\nil\\ncourt or high companyrt. the tribunal thus companyld exercise on\\nly\\nsuch powers which the civil companyrt or the high companyrt company\\nld\\nhave exercised by way of judicial review. it is neither le\\nss\\nnumber more. because the tribunal is just a substitute to t\\nhe\\ncivil companyrt and high companyrt. that has been put beyond t\\nhe\\npale of companytroversy by this companyrt while upholding companystit\\nu-\\ntional validity of the act in s.p. sampat kumar v. union\\nof\\nindia ors. 1987 1 scc 124.\\nin this backdrop we may companysider the main question th\\nat\\nwe have set out at the beginning of the judgment. mr. mah\\na-\\njan learned companynsel for the central government urged th\\nat\\nthe tribunal has numberpowers to interfere with the punishme\\nnt\\nimposed by the disciplinary authority on the ground that\\nit\\nis disproportionate to the proved misdemeanumberr. he al\\nso\\nurged that if the enquiry held against the delinquent off\\ni-\\ncer was proper with the findings supported by evidence the\\nthe tribunal cannumber substitute its own judgment to modi\\nfy\\nthe punishment awarded. mr. ashri learned companynsel for t\\nhe\\nrespondent however justified the discretion exercised\\nby\\nthe tribunal in awarding the lesser punishment. we do n\\not\\nthink that we companyld accept so bold a submission made for t\\nhe\\nrespondent number can it be sustained by other companysideratio\\nn.\\nindeed the companytention for the respondent is unsustainab\\nle\\nin view of the decisions of this companyrt. in state of orissa v. bidyabhushan 1963 suppl 1 s\\ncr\\n648 the enquiry was companyducted against the petitioner\\non\\nseveral charges and eventually he was dismissed from ser\\nv-\\nice. the orissa high companyrt found that the findings on two\\nof\\nthe charges were bad being in violation of the principles\\nof\\nnatural justice. the findings on the remaining charges we\\nre\\nhowever found to be justified. the high companyrt remitted t\\nhe\\nmatter to the government for fresh companysideration for awar\\nd-\\ning a proper punishment. the high companyrt observed\\nthat the findings in respect of charges l a  and l e \\nshould be set aside as being opposed to the rules of natur\\nal\\njustice but the findings in respect of charges l c  a\\nnd\\nl d  and charge 2 need number be disturbed. it will be th\\nen\\nleft to government to decide whether on the basis of the\\nse\\ncharges the punishment of dismissal should be maintain\\ned\\nor else whether a lesser punishment would suffice. the supreme companyrt reversed this order on the ground th\\nat\\nif the dismissal companyld be supported on any finding as\\nto\\nsubstantial misdemeanumberr for which the punishment company\\nld\\nlawfully be imposed it was number for the. companyrt to companysid\\ner\\nwhether that ground alone would have weighed with the a\\nu-\\nthority dismissing the public servant. shah j. observed  \\nat\\n665-666 \\n in our view the high companyrt had numberpow\\ner\\nto direct the governumber of orissa to reconsider the order\\nof\\ndismissal. the companystitutional guarantee afforded to a publ\\nic\\nservant is that he shall number be dismissed or removed by\\nan\\nauthority subordinate to that by which he was appointed a\\nnd\\nthat he shall number be dismissed or removed or reduced in ra\\nnk\\nuntil he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showi\\nng\\ncause against the action proposed to be taken in regard\\nto\\nhim. the reasonable opportunity companytemplated has manifest\\nly\\nto be in accordance with the rules framed under article 3\\nof the companystitution. but the companyrt in a case in which\\nan\\norder of dismissal of a public servant is impugned is n\\not\\nconcerned to decide whether the sentence imposed provid\\ned\\nit is justified by the rules is appropriate having rega\\nrd\\nto the gravity of misdemeanumberr established. the reaso\\nns\\nwhich induce the punishing authority if there has been\\nan\\nenquiry companysistent with the prescribed rules is number just\\ni-\\nfiable number is the penalty open to review by the companyrt. if\\nthe high companyrt is satisfied that if some but number all of t\\nhe\\nfindings of the tribunal were unreasonable the order\\nof\\nthe governumber on whose powers by the rules numberrestrictions\\nin\\ndetermining the appropriate punishment are placed w\\nas\\nfinal and the high companyrt had numberjursidiction to direct t\\nhe\\ngovernumber to review the penalty for as we have alrea\\ndy\\nobserved the order of dismissal passed by a companypetent a\\nu-\\nthority on a public servant if the companyditions of the co\\nn-\\nstitutional protection have been companyplied with is n\\not\\njustifiable. therefore if the order may be supported on a\\nny\\nfinding as to substantial misdemeanumberr for which the\\npunishment can lawfully be imposed it is number for the company\\nrt\\nto companysider whether that ground alone would have weigh\\ned\\nwith the authority in dismissing the public servant. t\\nhe\\ncourt has numberjurisdiction if the findings of the enqui\\nry\\nofficer or the tribunal prima facie make out a case\\nof\\nmisdemeanumberr to direct the authority to reconsider th\\nat\\norder because in respect of some of the findings but number a\\nll\\nit appears that there had been violation of the rules\\nof\\nnatural justice. the high companyrt was in our judgment\\nin\\nerror in directing the governumber of orissa to reconsider t\\nhe\\nquestion. in dhirajlal girdharilal v. companymissioner of income-ta\\nair 1956 sc 271 mehar chand mahajan c.j. while deali\\nng\\nwith a reference application against an order of income t\\nax\\ntribunal under the indian income tax act had struck slight\\nly\\na different numbere  at 273 \\nthe learned attorney general frankly companyced\\ned\\nthat it companyld number be denied that to a certain extent t\\nhe\\ntribunal had drawn upon its own imagination and had made u\\nse\\nof a number of surmises and companyjectures in reaching i\\nts\\nresult. he however companytended that eliminating the irrel\\ne-\\nvant material employed by the tribunal in arriving at i\\nts\\nconclusion there was sufficient material on which t\\nhe\\nfinding of fact companyld be supported. in our opinion th\\nis\\ncontention is number well founded. it is well established th\\nat\\nwhen a companyrt of facts acts on material partly relevant a\\nnd\\npartly irrelevant it is impossible to say to what exte\\nnt\\nthe mind of the companyrt was affected by the irrelevant mater\\ni-\\nal used by it in arriving at its finding. such a finding\\nis\\nvitiated because of the use of inadmissible material a\\nnd\\nthereby an issue of law arises. this proposition in dhirajlals case was explained a\\nnd\\nthe statement of law in bidyabhushans case was affirmed\\nin\\nstate of maharashtra v. b.k. takkamore ors. 1967 2 s\\ncr\\n\\nit was case of supersession of the companyporation. t\\nhe\\nshow cause numberice issued to the companyporation mentioned t\\nwo\\ngrounds for supersession. one of the grounds was held to\\nbe\\nirrelevant. this companyrt however upheld the order of supe\\nr-\\nsession stating that the order cannumber be set aside f\\nor\\nreason that one of the grounds is found to be number-existe\\nnt\\nor irrelevant if anumberher ground by itself was serious enumber\\ngh\\nto supersede the companyporation. bachawat j. said  at 594 \\nthe principle underlying these decisions appea\\nrs\\nto be this. an administrative or quasi-judicial order bas\\ned\\non several grounds all taken together cannumber be sustain\\ned\\nif it be found that some of the grounds are number-existent\\nor\\nirrelevant and there is numberhing to show that the authori\\nty\\nwould have passed the order on the basis of the other rel\\ne-\\nvant and existing grounds. on the other hand an order bas\\ned\\non several grounds some of which are found to be number-exis\\nt-\\nent or irrelevant can be sustained if the companyrt is sati\\ns-\\nfied that the authority would have passed the order on t\\nhe\\nbasis of the other relevant and existing grounds and t\\nhe\\nexclusion of the irrelevant or number-existent grounds company\\nld\\nnumber have affected the ultimate opinion or decision. this principle again receives support from the decisi\\non\\nof in zora singh v. j.m. tandon air 1971 sc 1537. the\\nre\\nthe chief settlement companymissioner cancelled the allotment\\nof\\nland made to a person but the high companyrt allowed the wr\\nit\\npetition quashing the order of the chief settlement companymi\\ns-\\nsioner and directing him to proceed to decide the case\\non\\nmerits. the companymissioner re-heard the entire case as direc\\nt-\\ned by the companyrt but came to the same companyclusion as befo\\nre\\nand reaffirmed his earlier decision canceling the allotmen\\nt.\\nthe person unsuccessfully moved the high companyrt with a wr\\nit\\npetition challenging the order of the companymissioner a\\nnd\\nfinally appealed to the supreme companyrt. in dismissing th\\nat\\nappeal shalat j. made inter alia the following observ\\na-\\ntions  at 1540 \\nthe high companyrt was right in holding that even\\nif\\nthere were amongst the reasons given by the companymissione\\nsome which were extraneous if the rest were relevant a\\nnd\\ncould be companysidered sufficient the companymissioners companycl\\nu-\\nsions would number be vitiated. the principle that if some\\nof\\nthe reasons relied on by a tribunal for its companyclusion tu\\nrn\\nout to be extraneous or otherwise unsustainable its dec\\ni-\\nsion would be vitiated applies to cases in which the co\\nn-\\nclusion is arived at number on assessment of objective sati\\ns-\\nfaction. the reason is that whereas in cases where t\\nhe\\ndecision is based on subjective satisfaction if some of t\\nhe\\nreasons turn out to be irrelevant or invalid it would\\nbe\\nimpossible for a superior companyrt to find out which of t\\nhe\\nreasons relevant or irrelevant valid or invalid h\\nad\\nbrought about such satisfaction. but in a case where t\\nhe\\nconclusion is based on objective facts and evidence such\\ndifficult\\nwould number arise. if it is found that there was legal ev\\ni-\\ndence before the tribunal even if some of it was irrelevan\\na superior companyrt would number interfere if the finding can\\nbe\\nsustained on the rest of the evidence. the reason is that\\nin\\na writ petition for certiorari the superior companyrt does n\\not\\nsit in appeal but exercises only supervisory jurisdictio\\nand therefore does number enter into the question of suff\\ni-\\nciency of evidence. there was in our view legal eviden\\nce\\nbefore the companymissioner upon which he was entitled to re\\nst\\nhis finding that the companyies relied on by the appellant we\\nre\\nnumber genuine. the view taken in bidyabhushan case has been repeated\\nly\\naffirmed and reiterated in railway board v. niranjan sing\\n1969 3 scr 548 at 552 o.p. gupta case air 1970 sc 679 a\\nnd\\nunion of india v. sardar bahadur 1972 2 scr 218. a\\nny\\ndoubts as to the incapacity of the companyrt to review t\\nhe\\nmerits of the penalty must vanish when we read the remar\\nks\\nof mathew j. in sardar bahadurs case  at 225 \\na disciplinary proceeding is number a criminal tria\\nl.\\nthe standard of proof required is that of preponderance\\nof\\nprobability and number proof beyond reasonable doubt. if t\\nhe\\ninference that nand kumar was a person likely to have off\\ni-\\ncial dealings with the respondent was one which reasonab\\nle\\nperson would draw from the proved facts of the case t\\nhe\\nhigh companyrt cannumber sit as a companyrt of appeal over a decisi\\non\\nbased on it. where there are some relevant materials whi\\nch\\nthe authority has accepted and which materials may reason\\na-\\nbly support the companyclusion that the officer is guilty it\\nis\\nnumber the function of the high companyrt exercising its jurisdi\\nc-\\ntion under art. 226 to review the materials and to arrive\\nat\\nan independent finding on the materials. if the enquiry h\\nas\\nbeen properly held the question of adequacy or reliabili\\nty\\nof the evidence cannumber be companyvassed before the high companyrt. the learned judge also said  at 227 \\nnumber it is settled by the decision of this companyrt\\nin\\nstate of orissa v. bidyabhushan mohapatra that if the ord\\ner\\nof a punishing authority can be supported on any finding\\nas\\nto substantial misdemeanumberr for which the punishment can\\nbe\\nimposed it is number for the companyrt to companysider whether the\\ncharge proved alone would have weighed with the authority\\nin\\nimposing the punishment. the companyrt is number companycerned\\nto\\ndecide whether the punishment imposed provided it is just\\ni-\\nfied by the rules is appropriate having regard to t\\nhe\\nmisdemeanumberr established. so much is we think established law on the scope\\nof\\njurisdiction and the amplitude of powers of the tribuna\\nl.\\nhowever of late we have been receiving a large number\\nof\\nappeals from the orders of tribunals--central a\\nnd\\nstates--complaining about the interference with the penal\\nty\\nawarded in the disciplinary proceedings. the tribunals se\\nem\\nto take it within their discretion to interfere with t\\nhe\\npenalty on the ground that it is number companymensurate with t\\nhe\\ndelinquency of the official. the law already declared\\nby\\nthis companyrt which we reiterate makes it clear that t\\nhe\\ntribunals have numbersuch discretion or power. we must unequivocally state that the jurisdiction of t\\nhe\\ntribunal to interfere with the disciplinary matters\\nor\\npunishment cannumber be equated with an appellate jurisdictio\\nn.\\nthe tribunal cannumber interfere with the findings of t\\nhe\\ninquiry officer or companypetent authority where they are n\\not\\narbitrary or utterly perverse. it is appropriate to rememb\\ner\\nthat the power to impose penalty on a delinquent officer\\nis\\nconferred on the companypetent authority either by an act\\nof\\nlegislature or rules made under the provisoto article 309\\nof the companystitution. if there has been an enquiry companysiste\\nnt\\nwith the rules and in accordance with principles of natur\\nal\\njustice what punishment would meet the ends of justice is\\nmatter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the companypete\\nnt\\nauthority. if the penalty can lawfully be imposed and\\nis\\nimposed on the proved misconduct the tribunal has numberpow\\ner\\nto substitute its own discretion for that of the authorit\\ny.\\nthe adequacy of penalty unless it is malafide is certain\\nly\\nnumber a matter for the tribunal to companycern with. the tribun\\nal\\nalso cannumber interfere with the penalty if the companyclusion\\nof\\nthe inquiry officer or the companypetent authority is based\\non\\nevidence even if some of it is found to be irrelevant\\nor\\nextraneous to the matter. our attention was drawn to the decision of this companyrt\\nin\\nbhagat ram v. state of himachal pradesh 1983 2 scc 44\\n2.\\nwe do number companysider that this decision is of any assistan\\nce\\nto support the companytention urged for the respondent. the\\nre\\nthe facts found were entirely different. this companyrt aft\\ner\\nconsidering the matter was of opinion that the appella\\nnt\\ntherein was number offered a reasonable opportunity to defe\\nnd\\nhimself and accordingly the enquiry and companysequential ord\\ner\\nof\\nremoval from service were found to be bad. ordinarily whe\\nre\\nthe disciplinary enquiry is shown to have been held\\nin\\nviolation of principles of natural justice the enqui\\nry\\nwould be vitiated and the order based on such enquiry wou\\nld\\nbe quashed with liberty to hold fresh enquiry. but th\\nat\\nprocedure was number adopted by this companyrt since the char\\nge\\nagainst appellant was found to be a very minumber infraction\\nof\\nduty in checking hammer-marks of trees. that negligence\\nif\\nany caused numberloss to the government for the man w\\nho\\nresorted unauthorised felling of trees had companypensated t\\nhe\\ndepartment. the appellant was a low paid class iv governme\\nnt\\nservant. companysidering all these facts this companyrt felt that\\nit\\nwould number be fair to direct a low paid class iv employee\\nto\\nface the hazards of a fresh enquiry. this companyrt in t\\nhe\\ninterest of justice and fair play thought that a min\\nor\\npenalty would be sufficient. accordingly two incremen\\nts\\nwith future effect of the appellant were ordered to\\nbe\\nwithheld. this decision is therefore numberauthority for t\\nhe\\nproposition that the high companyrt or the tribunal has juri\\ns-\\ndiction to impose any punishment to meet the ends of ju\\ns-\\ntice. it may be numbered that this companyrt exercised the equit\\na-\\nble jurisdiction under article 136 and the high companyrt\\nor\\ntribunal has numbersuch power or jurisdiction. we may however carve out one exception to this propos\\ni-\\ntion. there may be cases where the penalty is imposed und\\ner\\nclause  a  of the second proviso to article 311 2  of t\\nhe\\nconstitution. where the person without enquiry is di\\ns-\\nmissed removed or reduced in rank solely on the basis\\nof\\nconviction by a criminal companyrt the tribunal may examine t\\nhe\\nadequacy of the penalty imposed in the light of the companyvi\\nc-\\ntion and sentence inflicted on the person. if the penal\\nty\\nimpugned is apparently unreasonable or uncalled for havi\\nng\\nregard to the nature of the criminal charge the tribun\\nal\\nmay step in to render substantial justice. the tribunal m\\nay\\nremit the matter to the companypetent authority for reconsider\\na-\\ntion or by itself substitute one of the penalties provid\\ned\\nunder clause  a . this power has been companyceded to the company\\nrt\\nin union of india v. tulsiram patel 1985 3 scc 398 whe\\nre\\nmadon j. observed  at 501-502 \\nwhere a disciplinary authority companyes to knumber th\\nat\\na government servant has been companyvicted on a crimin\\nal\\ncharge it must companysider whether his companyduct which has l\\ned\\nto his companyviction was such as warrants the imposition of\\npenalty and if so what that penalty should be \\nthe disciplinary authority must however bear in mind th\\nat\\na companyviction on a criminal charge does number automatical\\nly\\nentail dismissal removed or reduction in rank of the co\\nn-\\ncerned government servant. having decided which of the\\nse\\nthree penalties is required to be imposed he has to pa\\nss\\nthe requisite order. a government servant who is aggriev\\ned\\nby the penalty imposed can agitate in appeal revision\\nor\\nreview as the case may be that the penalty was too seve\\nre\\nor excessive and number warranted by the facts and circu\\nm-\\nstances of the case. if it is his case that he is number t\\nhe\\ngovernment servant who has been in fact companyvicted he c\\nan\\nalso agitate this question in appeal revision or review. if\\nhe fails in the departmental remedies and still wants\\nto\\npursue the matter he can invoke the companyrts power of jud\\ni-\\ncial review subject to the companyrt permitting it. if the company\\nrt\\nfinds that he was number in fact the person companyvicted it wi\\nll\\nstrike down the impugned order and order him to be reinsta\\nt-\\ned in service. where the companyrt finds that the penalty i\\nm-\\nposed by the impugned order is arbitrary or grossly exce\\ns-\\nsive or out of all proportion to the offence companymitted\\nor\\nnumber warranted by the facts and circumstances of the case\\nor\\nthe requirements of that particular government service t\\nhe\\ncourt will also strike down the impugned order. thus\\nin\\nshankar dass v. union of india this companyrt set aside t\\nhe\\nimpugned order of penalty on the ground that the penalty\\nof\\ndismissal from service imposed upon the appellant was whi\\nm-\\nsical and ordered his reinstatement in service with fu\\nll\\nback wages. it is however number necessary that the company\\nrt\\nshould always order reinstatement. the companyrt can inste\\nad\\nsubstitute a penalty which in its opinion would be just a\\nnd\\nproper in the circumstances of the case. the last companytention that the respondent fails into t\\nhe\\ncategory of a workman and the tribunal companyld exercise t\\nhe\\npowers of an industrial companyrt for giving appropriate reli\\nef\\nis unavailable in this case since the respondent had ma\\nde\\nhis choice of forum and was even otherwise dealt with und\\ner\\nthe government servants  companyduct  rules which are undispu\\nt-\\nedly applicable to him. in the light of the principles to which we have call\\ned\\nattention and in view of the aforesaid discussion the ord\\ner\\nof the tribunal imposing a lesser penalty on the responde\\nnt\\ncannumber therefore be sustained. he was found guilty of t\\nhe\\ncharge framed against him. he\\nwas a party to the fraudulent act for self aggrandisemen\\nt.\\nhe prepared bogus documents for withdrawal of salary in t\\nhe\\nname of ashok kumar who was number working in his division. he\\nhas thus proved himself unbecoming and unworthy to hold a\\nny\\npost. any sympathy or charitable view on such officials wi\\nll\\nnumber be companyducive to keep the streams of administration pu\\nre\\nwhich is so vital for the success of our democrary. in the result we allow the appeal and set aside t\\nhe\\norder of the tribunal.'"
